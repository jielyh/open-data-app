		<h3>Audience</h3>
		<p><strong>Julie Hanes</strong></p>

		<p>Middle of July on a sunny day, Julie and her parents, along with her little brother just moved into the big city. Julie just got off of work at her new job working at a restaurant. 		She's stressed because of school and trying to make money to pay for her tuition for next semester and adjusting to the new city where she doesn't know anyone. She goes home, changes and takes her little brother out to the closest basketball court she can find to releive some stress. It's always nice to go out and have some alone time but it's even better when there is someone you can take with you.</p>
